## Motivations and Disclaimer

I worked on this repository those last days as I had some free hours. Fifteen days of unemployment before my future moving to Spain was for me the perfect opportunity to answer some pending questions that I had in mind, and more over, be able to really understand the fundamental ideas that some libraries are trying to express.

Something like one year ago, the dev community remember me that functional programming can be also applied to the web… [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) stateless components and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture first, and then through [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), … . My interest about functional programming and theories behind growth month after month.

Since, and from a while, I like to play with Redux and immutable data (mainly using [Immutable-js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) to be fair). And so, I decided to dedicate this time to experiment how [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) can be use to handle properly async and/or real-time state updates, and this using immutable data through an [universal application](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9). ([React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) handle client rendering, but it was not my first concern here). For this I needed an open API, and as I’m moving to Barcelona, I naturally chosen [Typeform.io](http://typeform.io/).

I’ll be brief by saying that I learned a lot, and had fun. But I’m sorry, I’ll not be able to work more on it for the moment. I have to move this week to Barcelona, and as a French citizens of Prague (Czech Republic), it’s not that easy to organise, at least it need some time. Then, I’ll go ahead and go deeper with [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)/[GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/), Virtual DOM, and acquire a better understanding [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) of [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) & [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) concepts. I’ll also PR some open sources projects until I’ll have a new regular job.

Maybe, I’ll work later on this application, at least reach a more stable version and why not include some fancy stuffs. But if you’re interest about that you found here, feel free to open an issue to discuss with me, I’ll help and provide feedback as I can.
