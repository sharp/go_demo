# [Typeform Builder](http://github.com/broucz/typeform-builder)

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/typeform-builder.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeform-builder)

## Install

To run this application, you'll need to have a Typeform I/O API-key already. If
you don't have it, get it by filling out [this signup form](https://io1.typeform.com/to/HMLOBl) and then:

```
git clone https://github.com/broucz/typeform-builder.git
cd typeform-builder
npm i
TYPEFORM_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npm start
```

## Disclaimer

As the application was quickly wrote this week end, many parts (currently partially handled) have to be reworked (app & data structure, messaging, features, UX, ...). **This version is just a minimal development build to work with.**
